    "In this workflow, PyCFRL takes in an offline trajectory and then preprocesses the offline trajectory using `SyntheticPreprocessor`. After that, the preprocessed trajectory is passed into `FQI` to train a counterfactually fair policy, which is then assessed using :code:`evaluate_reward_through_fqe()` and `evaluate_fairness_through_model()` based on a `SimulatedEnvironment` that mimics the transition rules of the true environment underlying the training trajectory. The final output of the workflow is the policy trained on the preprocessed data as well as its estimated value and counterfactual fairness metric. This workflow is appropriate when the user is interested in knowing the value and counterfactual fairness achieved by the trained policy when interacting with the true underlying environment.\n",

    "We now train the preprocessor and preprocess the trajectory. As demonstrated in the other workflows, we might want to first train the preprocessor using only a subset of the data, then preprocess the remaining subset of the data, and finally use the preprocessed subset for policy learning. However, when the amount of data is limited, the preprocessed trajectory resulting from the procedure above might be too small to be useful for policy learning. We essentially want to preprocess as many individuals as possible. Fortunately, we can directly preprocess all individuals using the `train_preprocessor()` function when we set `cross_folds` to a relatively large number.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `cross_folds=K` where `K` is greater than 1, `train_preprocessor()` will internally divide the training data into `K` folds. For each $i=1,\\dots,K$, it trains a transition dynamics model based on all the folds other than the $i$-th one, and this model is then used to preprocess data in the $i$-th fold. This results in `K` folds of preprocessed data, each of which is processed using a model that is trained on the other folds. These `K` folds of preprocessed data are then combined and returned by `train_preprocessor()`. This method allows us to preprocess all individuals in the trajectory while reducing overfitting.\n",
