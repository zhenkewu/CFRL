    "In this workflow, CFRL takes in an offline trajectory and then preprocesses the offline trajectory using `SyntheticPreprocessor`. After that, the preprocessed trajectory is passed into `FQI` to train a counterfactually fair policy, which is then assessed using :code:`evaluate_reward_through_fqe()` and `evaluate_fairness_through_model()` based on a `SimulatedEnvironment` that mimics the transition rules of the true environment underlying the training trajectory. The final output of the workflow is the policy trained on the preprocessed data as well as its estimated value and counterfactual fairness metric. This workflow is appropriate when the user is interested in knowing the value and counterfactual fairness achieved by the trained policy when interacting with the true underlying environment.\n",
